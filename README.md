# Simple REST API App Demo (Jetpack Compose)

Written in Kotlin. Built with Android Studio. 
With thanks to vinchamp77 Vincent Tsen for the original fork, which has since been completely rebuilt!  
  
  -------------------
  Just completed:  
  Footer for item page.  
  External Url for footer.
  
  Currently working on:
  Favourites button + functionality


Issues:   
Pull to refresh won't work - the project was forked with Jetpack Compose.  
Few options were available: https://github.com/google/accompanist was one of the, but it does not pick up "SwipeRefresh" with the dependency installed.  
I will have to skip this one.
